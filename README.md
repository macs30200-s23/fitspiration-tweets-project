# Fitspiration Tweets Project

The code and data in this repository belong to a project for MACS 30200 "Perspectives on Computational Research" at the University of Chicago.

The code is written in Python 3.9.13 and all of its dependencies can be installed by running the following in the terminal (with the `requirements.txt` file included in this repository):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can import the `analysis` module located in this repository to reproduce the analysis that this code supplements [insert an example].

```python
import analysis
```
